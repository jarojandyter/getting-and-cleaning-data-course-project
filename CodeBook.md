The original data was modified by using the following steps:
1) Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
3) Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4) Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5) Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
